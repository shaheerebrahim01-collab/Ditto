# Ditto — Roadmap

Status lives here, in the repo — not in chat history. Whoever (or whatever)
continues this project should read this file first.

- [x] Phase 1 — Repository architecture
- [x] Phase 2 — Database schema
- [x] Phase 3 — Authentication
- [ ] Phase 4 — Customer mobile app
- [ ] Phase 5 — Tailor mobile app
- [ ] Phase 6 — Admin dashboard
- [ ] Phase 7 — Suit rental ops
- [ ] Phase 8 — AI styling & measurements
- [ ] Phase 9 — Messaging & notifications
- [ ] Phase 10 — Payments
- [ ] Phase 11 — Production infrastructure
- [ ] Phase 12 — Testing & QA
- [ ] Phase 13 — Security hardening
- [ ] Phase 14 — Deployment
- [ ] Phase 15 — App Store & Google Play release prep

**Note on roles:** no dedicated "Delivery Partner" app role. Ditto uses an
in-person Tailor Assistant Partner Program instead (training, certificate,
registered at an office). `TailorAssistant` is in the schema for roster and
certification tracking, not as an app-facing account type.

## Phase 1 — repository architecture

NestJS backend skeleton in `backend/`: one module per domain
(`auth`, `users`, `tailors`, `rental-shops`, `orders`, `rentals`,
`payments`, `messaging`, `notifications`, `reviews`, `admin`), all wired into
`AppModule`. Shared `PrismaService`/`PrismaModule` (global). A real
`/health` controller.

**Verified:** `npm install` resolves cleanly (354 packages). `npm run build`
(`nest build`) compiles with zero errors.

## Phase 2 — database schema

`backend/prisma/schema.prisma` — 16 models / 5 enums covering users & roles,
tailor and rental-shop business profiles, tailor assistants, portfolio,
custom orders (with the production-stage enum from the prototype), rental
bookings, payments, reviews, messaging, notifications, wishlist, referrals,
and the business-application approval queue.

**Verified:** brace-balanced, every named relation appears on both sides,
every relation field type resolves to a real model — checked directly
against the schema text.

**Not verified here:** `prisma validate` / `prisma generate` need to
download a platform engine binary from `binaries.prisma.sh`, which this
sandbox's network allowlist doesn't include — so that specific check
couldn't run in this environment. Run it yourself right after cloning:
```bash
cd backend && npx prisma generate
```
It'll work normally on a machine with regular internet access. Booting the
server without having run that once will fail with `@prisma/client did not
initialize yet` — that's expected, not a bug, and confirmed in this sandbox.

## Phase 3 — authentication

`POST /auth/firebase` — verifies a Firebase ID token (Apple / Google /
Phone / Email sign-in happens client-side via Firebase; this endpoint is
where the client hands us that token). Finds or creates the matching
`User` row, then issues **our own** JWT — every other endpoint checks that
JWT and never talks to Firebase again.

`GET /users/me` — first protected endpoint, guarded by `JwtAuthGuard`.
Confirms the whole chain (`@nestjs/passport` → `JwtStrategy` →
`@CurrentUser()`) actually works, not just compiles.

**Verified:**
- `npm install`, `npm run build` — clean, 729 packages, zero compile errors
- `npm test` — 2/2 passing (JWT sign/verify round-trip, and that a token
  signed with the wrong secret is correctly rejected)
- Server still fails at boot for the one already-known reason (missing
  generated Prisma client) — confirmed no *new* startup errors from the
  auth module itself

**Not verified here, same reason as Phase 2:** the Firebase token
verification path itself needs a real Firebase project — `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`,
`FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` — which only
exists once you create one. That's a Phase 3 follow-up, not blocking: create
a Firebase project, enable Apple/Google/Phone/Email sign-in providers, drop
a service-account key's values into `.env`, and `POST /auth/firebase` is
live.

## Phase 4 — next up

Customer mobile app. First real Flutter code — talks to `/auth/firebase`
and `/users/me`, so those needed to exist first (they now do).
